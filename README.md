# Markdown To Jira

This was created to deal with the fact that I cannot paste my markdown content as a comment in JIRA.
If I copy my markdown into this converter and then paste the comment I can.

     git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
     git push
     ```

3. **Automatic deployment:**
